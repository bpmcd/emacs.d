* My Emacs Config

Simply clone this repo into ~/.emacs.d:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
git clone git@github.com:bobby/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC

Then start up Emacs, and watch whilst package.el and the non-ELPA packages are installed.

Restart Emacs, and the ELPA packages will also be installed and configured.  Yay el-get!
